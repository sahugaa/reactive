Problem:
In the complex landscape of JPMC's platform/component needs, traditional capacity planning falls short, often leading to inefficiencies and errors. Overprovisioning wastes resources, while underprovisioning risks performance issues. Manual methods struggle to keep up with dynamic requirements, resulting in suboptimal infrastructure allocation.

Problem:
In JPMC's dynamic environment, overengineering and underengineering are persistent challenges. Traditional capacity planning struggles to strike the right balance, leading to wasted resources or performance bottlenecks. Moreover, the escalating costs of cloud infrastructure add another layer of complexity, making it essential to manage these expenses effectively. Manual planning exacerbates these issues, often resulting in human errors, biases, and uninformed decisions. The lengthy review process further delays infrastructure deployment, hindering agility and innovation.

Solution:
Enter Systemizer, JPMC's solution to these multifaceted challenges. By automating capacity planning, Systemizer tackles overengineering and underengineering head-on, ensuring optimal resource allocation from the design phase. It empowers developers to accelerate the design process and bypass lengthy reviews, fostering agility and innovation. Moreover, Systemizer's AI-driven approach eliminates human errors and biases, providing informed recommendations tailored to JPMC's needs. Through instant infrastructure simulation and testing using provisioning and load scripts, Systemizer minimizes risks and maximizes efficiency. Teams can fine-tune requirements on the fly, simulating different scenarios and iterating until satisfied, ensuring the final solution meets JPMC's exact specifications. The result? Significant time and cost savings throughout the planning and deployment cycle, positioning JPMC for success in the rapidly evolving financial landscape.


Systemizer is designed to navigate these challenges, optimizing infrastructure planning from the ground up.

Step 1: Precision Planning for Optimal Resource Allocation:
In our industry, we often grapple with the balance between over-cautious provisioning and underestimations, leading to resource imbalances. Systemizer tackles this head-on by offering data-driven recommendations tailored precisely to your application's needs. By doing so, it not only prevents costly over-engineering but also mitigates the risk of under-provisioning.

Step 2: Early Cost Management Integration:
Systemizer's standout feature lies in its ability to integrate cost management at the design phase's outset. By simulating various infrastructure scenarios, it provides a clear cost overview, empowering decision-makers to select the most cost-effective option without sacrificing performance or scalability.

Step 3: Developer Empowerment and Accelerated Iterations:
With Systemizer, developers of all levels gain autonomy in generating and refining architectural designs independently. This self-service capability significantly reduces dependency on senior developers for reviews, hastening the design process and facilitating faster iterations.

Step 4: Bias-Free Decision-Making:
Manual capacity planning is susceptible to human error and bias. Systemizer eliminates these risks by leveraging machine learning to offer unbiased, precise infrastructure recommendations. This ensures decisions are rooted in data rather than subjective judgments.

Step 5: Seamless Simulation and Load Testing:
Post-architecture selection, Systemizer enables immediate real-world simulation using provided EAC and Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning. Furthermore, it empowers teams to test these environments under actual load conditions with load testing scripts, ensuring readiness to handle real-world demands.

Step 6: Quantifying Time and Cost Savings:
Systemizer dramatically reduces the cycle time from conceptualization to deployment, slashing traditional review and testing phases from weeks to mere days. This efficiency translates directly into cost savings, as faster deployment means quicker time to market and reduced labor costs. Moreover, its precision in resource allocation minimizes both capital expenditure on unused resources and operational costs stemming from system inefficiencies.


Conclusion:
With Systemizer, we're not just upgrading; we're reshaping how we approach capacity planning. It's our solution to the challenges of overengineering, underengineering, and managing cloud costs right from the start. By empowering developers to take the lead and streamlining the review process, we're slashing design time and getting it right the first time. Plus, with Systemizer's automated simulations and load testing, we're eliminating errors and saving both time and money. It's time to embrace Systemizer and transform our operations into lean, efficient machines.
