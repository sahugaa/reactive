**Problem Statement:**

"In the software industry, capacity planning processes often grapple with the complexities of over-engineering and under-engineering, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal resource utilization.

"Traditional capacity planning processes in the software industry are plagued by inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and lack of adaptability. Manual methods are cumbersome, time-consuming, and often fail to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology and changing user demands. As a result, organizations face several critical challenges:

As a result, organizations encounter several critical challenges:

1. **Suboptimal Resource Allocation:** Manual capacity planning tends to err on the side of caution, resulting in over-engineering of infrastructure to accommodate peak loads. This leads to under-utilization of resources during normal operation and increased infrastructure costs.

2. **Ineffective Scalability:** The inability to accurately forecast future resource requirements hampers organizations' ability to scale their infrastructure effectively. As workloads fluctuate and demand spikes occur, scaling becomes reactive rather than proactive, leading to performance bottlenecks and service disruptions.

3. **High Error Rates:** Human error is inherent in manual capacity planning processes, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in resource allocation. These errors can have significant repercussions, impacting system performance, user experience, and ultimately, business outcomes.

4. **Lack of Agility:** Manual capacity planning lacks the agility needed to respond quickly to changing business needs and market dynamics. With traditional methods, organizations struggle to adapt their infrastructure to evolving requirements, resulting in missed opportunities and competitive disadvantages.

Our project, the Capacity Planning Assistant, seeks to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning to automate and optimize capacity planning workflows. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights and predictive analytics, our tool empowers organizations to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall operational efficiency."
