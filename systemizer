How It Works:

Data Analysis and Modeling: Systemizer ingests vast data sets and employs machine learning algorithms, like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), to analyze key metrics such as Transactions per Second (TPS), latency, and bandwidth.
User Input and Preferences: Stakeholders input their specific requirements via a user-friendly JSON interface, indicating performance, scalability, cost, and compliance needs.
Algorithmic Processing: Leveraging sophisticated algorithms, Systemizer processes this data to generate personalized, data-driven recommendations for infrastructure architectures and resource allocations.
Output Files:

Recommendation File: A detailed document outlining optimal infrastructure setups.
Architecture File: A blueprint of the recommended infrastructure architecture.
EAC & Terraform Scripts: Scripts for provisioning the infrastructure reliably and consistently.
Load Testing Script: To validate performance under various scenarios.
Benefits:

Efficiency and Cost Savings: Streamlines the capacity planning process, drastically reducing both time and financial overhead.
Enhanced Productivity: Empowers developers to bypass lengthy reviews, accelerating development cycles.
Improved Decision Making: Supports well-prepared ARB meetings with data-backed architecture options.
Conclusion:
By adopting Systemizer, JPMC can significantly enhance its operational capabilities, leading the way in efficient, effective technology utilization. This tool not only meets the demands of todayâ€™s financial landscape but also positions JPMC as a leader in innovative infrastructure management.
