How It Works:

Systemizer provides significant value to our developers by enhancing their autonomy and proficiency. By reducing reliance on senior developer approvals, it allows our team members to make informed decisions quickly, streamlining project timelines. They gain hands-on experience with advanced technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and Infrastructure as Code, boosting their technical skills and career prospects. This tool not only accelerates development cycles but also fosters a culture of innovation and efficiency, empowering our developers to excel in a competitive tech environment."







Data Training: We begin by training our machine learning model using vast datasets gathered from the GTI ecosystem, along with industry-accepted "back of envelope" numbers. Specifically, we employ Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to comprehensively understand and define the intricate relationships within the data.
Engine Development: Next, we develop an engine on top of the machine learning model. This engine is designed to seamlessly accept user input in JSON format, encapsulating application requirements. Typically, this covers approximately 90% of Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), ensuring a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder needs.
Recommendation Generation: Leveraging the insights from our trained model, we generate multiple tailored recommendations. These recommendations come complete with trade-offs for informed decision-making. They include architectural YAML files, infrastructure provisioning scripts (EAC YAML), and model load testing scripts, offering a holistic solution for optimal system design and implementation.


Output Files:

Recommendation File: A detailed document outlining optimal infrastructure setups.
Architecture File: A blueprint of the recommended infrastructure architecture.
EAC & Terraform Scripts: Scripts for provisioning the infrastructure reliably and consistently.
Load Testing Script: To validate performance under various scenarios.


With Systemizer, we're not just upgrading; we're reshaping how we approach capacity planning. It's our solution to the challenges of overengineering, underengineering, and managing cloud costs right from the start. By empowering developers to take the lead and streamlining the review process, we're slashing design time and getting it right the first time. Plus, with Systemizer's automated simulations and load testing, we're eliminating errors and saving both time and money.


Benefits:

Efficiency and Cost Savings: Streamlines the capacity planning process, drastically reducing both time and financial overhead.
Enhanced Productivity: Empowers developers to bypass lengthy reviews, accelerating development cycles.
Improved Decision Making: Supports well-prepared ARB meetings with data-backed architecture options.
Conclusion:
By adopting Systemizer, JPMC can significantly enhance its operational capabilities, leading the way in efficient, effective technology utilization. This tool not only meets the demands of todayâ€™s financial landscape but also positions JPMC as a leader in innovative infrastructure management.
