Introduction:
At JPMC, identifying whether systems are overengineered or underengineered typically occurs only during production, leading to wasted resources or performance issues. Escalating cloud infrastructure costs require efficient management. Traditional manual capacity planning, often intensifying these challenges, introduces human errors and delays critical deployments.

Problem:
In JPMC's dynamic environment, overengineering and underengineering are persistent challenges. Traditional capacity planning struggles to strike the right balance, leading to wasted resources or performance bottlenecks. Moreover, the escalating costs of cloud infrastructure add another layer of complexity, making it essential to manage these expenses effectively. Manual planning exacerbates these issues, often resulting in human errors, biases, and uninformed decisions. The lengthy review process further delays infrastructure deployment, hindering agility and innovation.

Solution:
Enter Systemizer, JPMC's solution to these multifaceted challenges. By automating capacity planning, Systemizer tackles overengineering and underengineering head-on, ensuring optimal resource allocation from the design phase. It empowers developers to accelerate the design process and bypass lengthy reviews, fostering agility and innovation. Moreover, Systemizer's AI-driven approach eliminates human errors and biases, providing informed recommendations tailored to JPMC's needs. Through instant infrastructure simulation and testing using provisioning and load scripts, Systemizer minimizes risks and maximizes efficiency. Teams can fine-tune requirements on the fly, simulating different scenarios and iterating until satisfied, ensuring the final solution meets JPMC's exact specifications. The result? Significant time and cost savings throughout the planning and deployment cycle, positioning JPMC for success in the rapidly evolving financial landscape.

How It Works:

1.Data Analysis and Modeling: Using machine learning, specifically Gradient Boosting Machines, Systemizer analyzes key metrics such as Transactions per Second (TPS), latency, and bandwidth to predict future needs.
2.User Input and Preferences: Stakeholders input performance, scalability, cost, and compliance requirements through a JSON interface.
3.Algorithmic Processing: Sophisticated algorithms generate personalized infrastructure recommendations, which are then detailed in various output files.

Output Files:
Recommendation File: Details optimal setups.
Architecture File: Provides a blueprint of the infrastructure.
EAC & Terraform Scripts: Enable consistent and reliable provisioning.
Load Testing Script: Validates performance under different scenarios.
