Overview
This Confluence page serves as the central repository for all documentation, discussions, and updates related to our project on volatile memory analysis for cloud container nodes. Our aim is to utilize open-source tools such as AVML, dwarf2json, and Volatility 3 to provide an alternative to commercial solutions, enhancing transparency, reducing costs, and increasing flexibility.

Problem Statement
Teams currently rely on expensive commercial tools leveraging the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) to monitor container activities. This approach incurs high costs, promotes vendor lock-in, and lacks transparency, hindering effective security audits and system customization.

Proposed Solution
Our project proposes using a combination of AVML, dwarf2json, and Volatility 3 to capture and analyze the volatile memory of cloud container nodes. This method will allow for real-time monitoring and detailed insight into container behavior, providing a robust alternative to commercial software.

Goals and Objectives
Reduce Dependency on Commercial Tools: Minimize reliance on costly commercial solutions by adopting open-source alternatives.
Enhance Security and Transparency: Improve security audits and system transparency through accessible and modifiable open-source tools.
Foster Innovation and Flexibility: Encourage innovation with flexible, adaptable solutions that can be tailored to specific organizational needs.
Implementation Steps
Environment Setup: Establish a test environment in our cloud infrastructure for safe experimentation.
Tool Integration: Integrate AVML, dwarf2json, and Volatility 3 to capture and analyze memory data.
Testing and Validation: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the tools provide accurate and valuable insights.
Documentation and Training: Document the entire process and train relevant teams on how to use the new tools effectively.
Expected Outcomes
Cost Reduction: Significant reduction in monitoring and security-related expenditures.
Improved Operational Efficiency: Faster, more flexible responses to security incidents and system anomalies.
Increased Security Posture: Enhanced ability to detect and respond to threats through detailed memory analysis.

FAQs
What is eBPF?
eBPF stands for extended Berkeley Packet Filter, a technology that allows for safe and efficient programs to run on the kernel level without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules.

How does Volatility 3 help in forensic analysis?
Volatility 3 is a forensic analysis tool that provides detailed information about memory usage, helping identify suspicious activities and system anomalies.
